All of a sudden, there was no Bluetooth audio in my car (Corolla 2016), when paired with my iPhone. It has been working fine, so far. As usual, I did not RTFM. Not sure, if that would have helped. I could have leaved with out the music but it was difficult to follow Google Map's navigation instruction. Yes, I use Google Maps instead of the default. I had to keep looking at the phone, quite a often.

Then I figured out, that I could connect the phone as a USB device and the audio was back. I could play music from iPhone too. But, there is no way to control the music from the car, only from the phone, as it has been acting as a audio streaming service. I kept [searching for a resolution](https://www.google.com/search?q=bluetooth%20no%20sound%20in%20car%20iphone) and came across [Get help connecting your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch with your car stereo](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203412). I followed the instructions, but still the problem persisted.

The post suggested to turn Bluetooth off and on again, from the [Control Center](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202769). I did that again, this time I noticed the [volume control](http://i.imgur.com/zHvdIvb.jpg) just below the playback control. Holy crap, somehow the volume was set to minimum. I turned it to maximum and everything is back to normal.

Unnecessarily, I carried out the following steps.

* turned Bluetooth off and on
* restarted my iPhone
* unpaired the Bluetooth connection
* restarted the car
* restarted phone again
* paired the Bluetooth connection
