At the time of creating the porject, I could not find the books.
Neither in print nor in digitized format.

But managed to collect few of the images and thus created [part of part I](https://github.com/sarbbottam/sahaj-path/blob/master/%E0%A6%B8%E0%A6%B9%E0%A6%9C%20%E0%A6%AA%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%A0%20-%20%E0%A7%A7.pdf).

However both the versions are now available at [archive.org](https://archive.org/).
