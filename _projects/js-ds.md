Front-End development is no longer restricted to DOM scripting and DHTML,
but full-fledged client side rich interactive applications.
Knowledge on data-structure and algorithm is highly necessary.
For example, knowledge of tree traversal, is required for efficient DOM traversal and manipulation.

Front-End developers like me, comprehends JavaScript much better than any other programming language.
The purpose of this repository is to serves as a data-structure guide/reference for folks with JavaScript background.

Please refer [js-ds repository](https://github.com/sarbbottam/js-ds) for further details.
