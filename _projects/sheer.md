Sheer is a customizable and extendable CSS framework.
It is a collection of modular .css files, which are processed with [PostCSS]( https://github.com/postcss/postcss) and its [eco system]( https://github.com/postcss/postcss#plugins) to generate the customized CSS.

With sheer, one generates the CSS from the multiple modular, variables driven, boilerplates.
So one gets, only what is desired, with out any overhead.

Sheer is completely configurable and driven by variables.
One can override the variables and the generated CSS will be based on the overridden value of the variables. No extra, overridden statements.
