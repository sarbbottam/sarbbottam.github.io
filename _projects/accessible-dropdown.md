Till date, there is no way to style native `<select>/<option>`.
For example, there is no way to display a **flag** against the **country name** option. Something like the image below.
![Country drop down with flags associated to the corresponding country option](http://i.imgur.com/iopqi1Z.png){: .center-block .w-300px}

As the name suggests, it supports full keyboard interaction as well as compatible with screen readers.
